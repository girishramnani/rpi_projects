# Rpi data monitor starter project

This project provides a gui for showing stats from rpi.
<br>
I have kept 4 fields for now but that can be increased by changing the `.ui` file.
And then using the `pyui4` translate it to a `py` file.

<br>
For now the UI looks like this.

<hr>
## TODO

<br>
+ Provide a realtime graph to show the changing values.
+ use slots and events instead of a seperate thread. ( using seperate threads is not so Qt style)
